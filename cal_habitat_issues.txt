Create a "Max Dome" size
Find out how many "Max" domes we'd need to get the area requirement for lab and farm
	(e.g. Farm Area=200m^2, Max Area = 100m^2, need 2 domes / Lab Area = 5m^2, Max Area = 100m^2, need 1 dome)

Find area of resulting dome for each type based on how many we'd need
	(e.g. Farm Dome Area = 100m^2 / Lab Area = 5m^2)
	
Find volume of material to make each dome with the given area 

Find volume of hub dome (static)

Find volume of all the connector tubes required

Total all the volumes up based on the max radius given, find the minimum volume and the corresponding radius

Issues:
Required areas that are too small result in a radius for the dome that is smaller than the connection tubes.
Need to create a minimum dome size as well (something like 2.5m interior radius)
